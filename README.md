## Activity: Languages and Finite Automata ðŸ¤–

[cite_start]This repository contains the Python implementation of several exercises related to the theory of formal languages and automata. [cite: 1] [cite_start]The project covers the construction and simulation of Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA), Finite Automata (FA), and Pushdown Automata (PDA) to recognize different languages. [cite: 1]

[cite_start]This work fulfills the activity's requirements, which include the manual resolution of the problems and the implementation of each solution in Python, using a collaborative workflow on GitHub. [cite: 1]

### **Exercises Description**

[cite_start]Python solutions were implemented for the 7 proposed problems. [cite: 1] [cite_start]Each solution is a function that simulates the behavior of the corresponding automaton and determines whether an input string belongs to the specified language. [cite: 1]

Each problem is detailed below:

* [cite_start]**Problem 1:** A **DFA** with a maximum of 4 states was programmed to accept the language represented by the regular expression `((01+10)(11)*0)*(01+10)(11)*` over the alphabet Î£={0,1}. [cite: 1]
* [cite_start]**Problem 2:** A **DFA** was defined for the language formed by strings where the number of 'a's is even and no 'bc' substring exists. [cite: 1]
* [cite_start]**Problem 3:** A **Finite Automaton** was built that accepts a language with the following three conditions: [cite: 1]
    * [cite_start]If the string has no '1's, it must have an even number of '0's. [cite: 1]
    * [cite_start]If it has an even number of '1's (>0), it must end with an odd number of '0's. [cite: 1]
    * [cite_start]If it has an odd number of '1's, it must end with an even number of '0's. [cite: 1]
* [cite_start]**Problem 4:** A **DFA** was implemented for the language L_3 = L_1 âˆª L_2, which corresponds to strings of alternating '0's and '1's, where L_1 = {(01)^n | n >= 0} and L_2 = {(10)^n | n >= 0}. [cite: 1]
* [cite_start]**Problem 5:** A **DFA** equivalent to the regular expression `(((0+10)(10)*(11+0))+11)(0+1)*` was built. [cite: 1]
* [cite_start]**Problem 6:** A **Pushdown Automaton (PDA)** was programmed to recognize the language L = {a^i b^j c^k a^i | i, j > 0; k = j}. [cite: 1]
* [cite_start]**Problem 7:** A **Pushdown Automaton (PDA)** was implemented for the language of strings where the number of 'a's is greater than or equal to the number of 'b's (n_a(w) >= n_b(w)). [cite: 1]
